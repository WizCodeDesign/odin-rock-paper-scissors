# Odin Rock Paper Scissor Game  
<br/>
This is a project for the odin project course, a rock paper scissor game where the player picks from three choices (rock or paper or scissor) and the game compares the player's choice with the computer's randomly picked choice.  
<br/>
There are 5 rounds in the game, each round either the player's score or the computer's score increases depending on who won the round.
